You need Maven 2.2.0 or later to build project.
You can download it from http://maven.apache.org/download.html

1. Build war.
   
   Build and install it in local maven repository:
   mvn clean install.
   
   Create war but do not install it in maven repository:
   mvn package
   
   As result you will get ${PROJECT_HOME}/target/book-service.war.
   You can deploy it at apache-tomcat or other servlet container and try
   it (see section 3). jar file that can be add in already existed web
   application available at ${PROJECT_HOME}/target/book-service/WEB-INF/lib/books-service.jar

2. Run project with maven-jetty plugin.
   Run command: mvn jetty:run.

3. How to try.
   Point you web browser to http://localhost:8080/book-service/books/101.
   You will see JSON representation of book:
   {"id":"101","author":"Vincent Massol","title":"JUnit in Action","price":19.37,"pages":386}
    
   If you are under linux or other unix like OS the you can use curl utility
   (often it is already installed). Binary build of this utility available for
   windows also at http://curl.haxx.se/download.html. With curl you able to add
   new book in storage via command:

   curl -X PUT \
   -H "Content-type:application/json" \
   -d '{"author":"My Author","title":"My Title","price":1.00,"pages":100}' \
   http://localhost:8080/book-service/books/
